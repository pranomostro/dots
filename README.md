Thanks
------

Thanks to everybody developing configurable, open and good
software. It can't be said enough.
Special thanks to the guys from suckless.org and to z3bra,
dcat and several others for developing wmutils.
Many thanks also to lemonboy for his bar, the GNU guys,
because I still use their coreutils (they still suck :P).
Thanks to that guy who wrote sxhkd inventing such an
inmmemorable name.
