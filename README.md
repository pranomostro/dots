Dotfiles
========

These are my dotfiles, managed with an ugly makefile (if you know how to assign
a default rule to all operations, tell me, please).

Installation
------------

Copy this into ~/dots, then run

	make

This should install the dotfiles in the right place.

Thanks
------

Thanks to everybody developing configurable, open and good
software. It can't be said enough.
Special thanks to the guys from suckless.org and to z3bra,
dcat and several others for developing wmutils.
Many thanks also to lemonboy for his bar, the GNU guys,
because I can use their coreutils (they still suck :P).
Thanks to that guy who wrote sxhkd inventing such an
inmmemorable name. And of course I copied the gdb
config from [here](https://github.com/cyrus-and/gdb-dashboard).
